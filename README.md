# cs224w-ogbl-ddi
Final Project for CS22W: Machine Learning with Graphs course (http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/). We applied graph ML techniques and networks (such as the Graph Convolutional Network, GraphSAGE Network and Graph Isomorphism Network) to the ogbl-ddi dataset (https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/linkprop/#ogbl-ddi) for drug-drug interactions.
