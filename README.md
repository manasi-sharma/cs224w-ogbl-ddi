## Final Project -- Predicting Drug Interactions with Graph Neural Networks

This is the code for the Final Project for the CS224W: Machine Learning with Graphs course at Stanford University (http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/). For this project, I collaborated with Maya Srikanth and Arpita Singhal.

We applied graph ML techniques and networks (such as the Graph Convolutional Network, GraphSAGE Network and Graph Isomorphism Network) to the ogbl-ddi dataset (https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/linkprop/#ogbl-ddi) for drug-drug interactions.

You can access our Medium tutorial describing our approach and results at https://medium.com/@mayassrikanth/f63aab06b0b and our Colab with the complete codebase at https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BVNVkUStF8muqFGwb25j1sgReeGy7xaW?usp=sharing.
