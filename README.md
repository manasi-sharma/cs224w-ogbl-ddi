## Final Project -- Predicting Drug Interactions with Graph Neural Networks

This is the code for the Final Project of the CS224W: Machine Learning with Graphs course at Stanford University (http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/) in Autumn '21. For this project, I collaborated with Maya Srikanth and Arpita Singhal.

We applied graph ML techniques and networks (such as the Graph Convolutional Network, GraphSAGE Network and Graph Isomorphism Network) to the ogbl-ddi dataset (https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/linkprop/#ogbl-ddi) for drug-drug interactions.

You can access our Medium tutorial describing our approach and results at https://medium.com/@mayassrikanth/f63aab06b0b and our Colab with the complete codebase at https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BVNVkUStF8muqFGwb25j1sgReeGy7xaW?usp=sharing.

Our post was selected by the CS224W staff as particularly impressive and eligible to be published on the course's blog (still in progress): https://medium.com/stanford-cs224w.

Our highest Test Hits@20 value, 56.14% from the GIN network, exceeds lower scores on the ogbl-ddi Benchmark Leaderboard (https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/leader_linkprop/#ogbl-ddi), and would currently place at position 10 on the Leaderboard. We are working on possibly including our results on the Leaderboard website.
